Currently there are two designs being discussed:

1. Raspbery Pi based solution - A hat for the Raspbery Pi would control a Stepper motor, LED array, fans, and endstop. An HDMI to MIPI adapter will be used to control the print screen.

2. A All-In-One control board - Similar to the one provided by CBD. The board would have a microcontroller to handle the Stepper motor, LED array, fans, and endstop. It would have an FPGA to control the print screen.
